# LoanPredictionAnalysis

For this project I have completed a loan prediction analysis where it is predicted whether a loan application will be approved or not. Attributes such as gender, education, and applicant income are taken to make those predictions.First, the data was cleaned by finding the null values and replacing them with the mean for numerical valuses and the mode for categorical values. An exploratory data analysis was performed to vizualize the distribution of the applicants in each criterian that is being analyzed. Correllation matrix is done to drop highly correlated attributes and to create new attributes. Label encoding is used to convert categorical attributes to numerical. Data is then split for training and testing. Model training is then performed to find the model with the highest accuracy levels. Random rainforest is chosen and then hyperparameters are changed to further increase accuracy. Lastly a confusion matrix is used to summarize the prediction results. The results are finally presented on a heat map.
